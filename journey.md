As someone who’s a bit of a Chatterbox (but only with a chosen few), mujhe message bhejne ke bajaye yeh website ka idea zyada personal laga 😁. 
Messages toh dher saare karne padte hain but this is a single way with long expressions. 
So... Read this fully okay? Don’t judge too early. I keep it as a story.

# 🌟 Journey of Our Friendship : From Class 11th to Today

```text
If I remember correctly, humari dosti shuru hui Class 11th se, and since then we've grown, laughed, and evolved together. Honestly, mere extrovert nature ke wajah se tab “almost” most of our classmates mere dost the/thi. But our bond was never just casual, it always felt deeper, more grounded.

You’ve always had that mature, trustworthy, and calm vibe. From the beginning, there was something different about you and maybe that’s why we’re still here, today, as friends.

You're that rare person jiske saath I feel safe sharing anything. Whenever I felt stuck, I turned to you—not just for comfort, but because your opinions gave me a new perspective. You always listened with maturity, and that’s a gift few people carry.

# 🌷 Today & Beyond

```text
Now, reading all this... I presume that you won't take anything the wrong way. Me tmhare sath hamesha se emotions & expressions respectful and healthy rakhne ki koshish ki hai aur aage bhi koshish rahegi, by the way I know others too 😁.

I’ve always valued people not for what they have or wear or where they live—but for who they truly are. And you, you’ve always been that kind of person. I respect you. I trust you. If tears ever showed up, I know you’re one of the very few I’d feel okay shedding them with. And I like the way ki mere muh pe agar meri galti ya kami h to tm nikalte ho without hesitation & me ummed krunga ki ese hi raho warna jhuthi tareef krne wale bahut mile hain and hote bhi hain.

Even as an extrovert, I’ve always respected the privacy of my heart. And you’re one of the few people jinke saath woh boundary naturally dissolve ho jaati hai.

And as per my biggest lesson of my life, I learnt a lot, maybe there will be more such lessons but Now I am a little bit immune. So Now I believe that
"Real happiness is giving happiness to the people who matter, without expecting anything back."

Now I just want to keep those close to me happy, safe, and encouraged, helping them fly higher, dream bolder, and shine brighter. As they say, unchaiyan choone ka maza tab aata hai jab apke bachpan ke dost sath me sidiyan chade hon and manzil par pahuchen. Warna Life me aur bhi milte hain but is umra me aur aajka time dekhte hue, utne trust worthy people milne ke chances kafi kam rhte hain.
